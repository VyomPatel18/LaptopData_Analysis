In this project, I utilized the dataset provided in laptop_data.csv and performed the data processing tasks as specified in Laptop Data Task.txt. After completing all the preprocessing steps, I trained predictive models using Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms and saved the final work in Laptop Data.ipynb.

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

### Cleaning and Formatting Data:
1. Removed the 'GB' unit from the Ram column and converted it to an integer.  
2. Removed the 'KG' unit from the Weight column and changed its data type to float.

### Feature Engineering:
1. Added a new binary column Touchscreen, assigning 1 where a touchscreen is available and 0 otherwise.  
2. Added a new binary column IPS, assigning 1 where IPS technology is available and 0 otherwise.  
3. Split the Resolution column into two new columns: X_Res (horizontal resolution) and Y_Res (vertical resolution).  
4. Calculated the PPI (Pixels Per Inch) using the formula:  
   \[
   ppi = \frac{\sqrt{(X_{Res}^2 + Y_{Res}^2)}}{Inches}
   \]  
5. Extracted CPU Name from the CPU column to categorize processor types.

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Linear Regression Model:
- Trained a Linear Regression model to predict laptop prices based on available features.  
- Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.

### Random Forest Model:
- Implemented a Random Forest Regressor to improve predictive accuracy.  
- Tuned hyperparameters like the number of estimators and maximum depth for better performance.  
- Compared model performance with Linear Regression using the same evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion
- The Random Forest model performed better than Linear Regression in terms of predictive accuracy due to its capability to capture complex relationships.  
- Feature engineering played a crucial role in improving model performance.  
- The project successfully demonstrated data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model training for laptop price prediction.  
- All the tasks were implemented in **Laptop Data.ipynb**, making the dataset ready for analysis and predictive modeling.
